# SAP Automation Script - Fixed Version

This script automates SAP operations for invoice and order processing. The original code contained several critical bugs that have been fixed in this version.

## Bugs Fixed

### 1. **Security Vulnerability - Hardcoded Credentials and Paths**
**Original Issue**: The code contained hardcoded file paths and credentials exposed in plain text throughout the codebase, creating a major security vulnerability.

**Fix Applied**:
- Implemented configuration management using `config.ini` file
- Added `load_config()` function to centralize configuration
- Moved all hardcoded paths and credentials to external configuration
- Added proper error handling for missing configuration files
- Created automatic config file generation if missing

**Security Benefits**:
- Credentials and paths are no longer exposed in source code
- Configuration can be easily changed without modifying code
- Better separation of concerns between code and configuration

### 2. **Logic Error - Incorrect DataFrame Filtering**
**Original Issue**: The filtering logic for separating invoices and orders had a logical flaw that could miss valid records due to improper handling of null values and empty strings.

**Fix Applied**:
- Improved null value checking using `notna()` instead of `notnull()`
- Added proper string conversion and trimming with `astype(str).str.strip()`
- Enhanced the logic to handle edge cases with empty strings and whitespace
- Added validation to ensure data integrity before processing

**Logic Improvements**:
```python
# Before (buggy):
df_factura = df_facturas[
    df_facturas["Factura"].notnull() & (df_facturas["Factura"] != "")
]

# After (fixed):
df_factura = df_facturas[
    df_facturas["Factura"].notna() & 
    (df_facturas["Factura"].astype(str).str.strip() != "")
]
```

### 3. **Performance Issue - Inefficient Excel Operations**
**Original Issue**: The code opened Excel files inefficiently and didn't properly handle file closures, which could lead to resource leaks and Excel processes remaining open.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created `safe_read_excel()` function with proper error handling
- Implemented `get_credentials_from_excel()` with proper resource management
- Added try-finally blocks to ensure Excel applications are properly closed
- Set Excel application visibility to False for better performance
- Added file existence checks before attempting to read files

**Performance Benefits**:
- Proper resource cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Better error handling prevents crashes
- Improved file handling efficiency

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Required packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `win32com`, `configparser`
- SAP GUI installed and configured
- Excel files in the specified locations

### Configuration
1. The script will automatically create a `config.ini` file on first run
2. Modify the configuration file to match your environment:
   - Update file paths in the `[PATHS]` section
   - Configure SAP connection details in the `[SAP]` section
   - Set credential cell references in the `[CREDENTIALS]` section

### Running the Script
```bash
python comp.py
```

## File Structure
```
├── comp.py          # Main script (fixed version)
├── config.ini       # Configuration file
├── README.md        # This documentation
└── [Excel files]    # Your data files
```

## Error Handling
The improved version includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Missing configuration files
- File not found errors
- Empty data files
- SAP connection issues
- Excel file access problems

## Security Notes
- Never commit the `config.ini` file to version control if it contains sensitive credentials
- Consider using environment variables for production deployments
- Regularly update credentials and connection strings
- Monitor access logs for suspicious activity

## Migration from Original Version
1. Backup your original script
2. Replace with the new version
3. Update the `config.ini` file with your specific paths and settings
4. Test with a small dataset before running on production data
